# KnitTimerandRowCounter
Timer and Row counter for knitting made in react


To begin, open your terminal and CD to the location of the knittimer folder. I would set this somewhere easy, such as the desktop.<br/>

Then, run the react app with ```npm run start```

The timer and rowcounter will be available for you at [https://localhost:3000/](https://localhost:3000/)<br/>
Requires Node, and React to be installed.
